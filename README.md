### Day-to-Day Approach
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

- Have a stand up when everyone gets on Remo.
- During the standup, be open to asking questions about what others are working on to better understand.
- Partner with someone working on the aspect you need more time understanding if necessary.

**NOTE**: Undoing, redoing, replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

### Conflict Plan
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict when it arises?
- Everyone stops working and talks about it like adults.
- If that does not work, ask Ryan to mediate.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- Communicate and address the issue as a whole.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- Understand that everyone is in different parts of the journey.
- Help out if someone is stuck and come together to solve the problem.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- Bring it up with the team as soon as possible and talk through the issues.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- When talking and mediation do not seem to work.

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

### Communication Channels
- Slack: Group chat
- GitHub Org: [https://github.com/final-project-401](https://github.com/final-project-401)
- Trello: [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/8BQmrt5O/ATTIea34307eea7229049ddd8522c4132a7b9A70D9FA/project-management)

#### Hours Available to Communicate
| Team Member   | Hours Available (PST)  |

### Communication Plan
What platforms will you use to communicate?
- Slack and Remo

How often will you take breaks?
- As often as needed.

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- Talk through any roadblocks at daily standup.

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- Slack

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
- Daily stand-ups

How will you ensure you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
- Ensure everyone knows that we're all in this together and here to support each other.

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems. This should prevent "lone wolf" efforts and "siloed" efforts.

### Work Plan
How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
- Break down daily tasks into smaller problems.
- Allow individuals to work on the parts they are happy about.

What project management tool will be used?
- Trello: [https://trello.com/invite/b/8BQmrt5O/ATTIea34307eea7229049ddd8522c4132a7b9A70D9FA/project-management](https://trello.com/invite/b/8BQmrt5O/ATTIea34307eea7229049ddd8522c4132a7b9A70D9FA/project-management)

**NOTE**: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

## Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy with all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

## Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your "practice run" of your presentation. This should either be an exact time or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Practice Session 1:
Practice Session 2:
